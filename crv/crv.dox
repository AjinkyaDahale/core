/** \page crv CRV

The crv library is a library to support curved meshes,
meant to perform all traditional meshing operations 
for curved elements. Currently, Bezier simplices are supported.

There is also support for visualization of high-order fields, 
on linear or curved meshes, through writeCurvedVtuFiles, 
which uses subdivision to output into current paraview format.

There are several example files that test and make use of this functionality
all starting with bezier<testname>
